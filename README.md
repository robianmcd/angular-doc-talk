_Putting the talk back in dalkumentation!_

This project is meant to demonstrate some of the basics of building a web app with AngularJS and Firebase. If you want to fork the repo and try it out with your own instance of firebase just modify the line: `this.dbRef = new Firebase('https://angular-doc-talk.firebaseio.com');` in `app.js`. Then you just need to serve up the files in the root directory and you should be good to go.

This site is available through [Firebase Hosting](https://angular-doc-talk.firebaseapp.com/) or through [Github Pages](http://robianmcd.github.io/angular-doc-talk).
